# Syntax Tree

## Background

This was an example I came up - perform a word substitution in natural language and maintain coherence of the sentence. This feels like something an LLM shoudl be fairly good at - the only tricky part is the bridge between mechanistically substitution a specific word and the natural language coherence part that I expect it to be very good at.

## Conclusion

It does seem to be quite capable of this task. This one was a bit strange though, it only worked on one example set when I accidentally included an incorrect answer. It would be good to come up with many more examples to test this more thoroughly.
