# Parity

## Background

This example was inspired by this blog post: **Shawn Tan** - [The New XOR Problem (2023)](https://blog.wtf.sg/posts/2023-02-03-the-new-xor-problem/)

The problem is to calculate the parity of a bitstring.

## Conclusion

GPT-4 was better at this task. It stayed on track much better, answering in the intended format. It did not have perfect performance, it dropped some reasoning steps in one example but still got the correct result.
In run 2 ChatGPT creatively tried to solve the problem in its own way.
