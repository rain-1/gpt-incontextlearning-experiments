[ChatGPT] A: To determine the parity of this sequence, we need to count the number of 1's in the sequence. There are a total of 9 ones in the sequence, so the parity is 1.
[Me]A: 0 
[ChatGPT] flips 1 flips 0 stays 1 flips 0 flips 1 flips 0 stays 0 stays 1 flips 1 flips 1 flips 1, so the parity is 0. [WRONG]
[GPT4]A: 0 flips 1 flips 0 flips 1 stays 1 flips 0 flips 1 stays 1 stays 1 flips 0 flips 1 so the parity is 1 [RIGHT ANSWER WRONG REASONING, SKIPPED flips 0 flips 1]
