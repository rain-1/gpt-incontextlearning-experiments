Took a random chess game from https://www.family-games-treasurehouse.com/sample_chess_game.html and added some internal monologue for what white is thinking. GPT-4 completes it:

prompt:
```
    1. e4 e5
{standard pawn, pawn opening. I think I'll jump my right knight out to the left}
    2. Nf3 d6
    3. d4 Bg4
{oh I didn't expect black to move his bishop out. I better do en passant.}
    4. d4xe5 Bxf3
{OK. his bishop is getting scarily close. I'm going to use my queen to protect myself}
    5. Qxf3 d6xe5
{Two can play at that game. I'll move my bishop out too.}
    6. Bc4 Nf6
    7. Qb3 Qe7
{Might jump my left knight out too. Get more pieces advancing. This should open things up for my other bishop to advance.}
    8. Nc3 c6
    9. Bg5 b5
    10. Nxb5 c6xb5
{Here's an opportunity to check him!}
    11. Bxb5+ Nd7
    12. 0-0-0 Rd8
```

GPT4:
```
{Black is trying to defend against my aggressive play. I'll keep the pressure on by pinning the knight with my bishop.}
    13. Bxd7+ Rxd7
{Now I'll double my rooks on the d-file to increase pressure on the pinned piece.}
    14. Rxd7 Qxd7
    15. Rd1 Qc7
{Black is trying to defend, but I can still maintain pressure by moving my queen to a more square.}
    16. Qb5+ Nd7
{Now I'll move my bishop back to maintain the pin on the knight.}
    17. Be3 Bd
{I can see a tactic to win material here. I'll first move my queen to a more aggressive square, attacking the pinned knight and threatening to capture it.}
    18. Qa4 Ke7
{Black is trying to defend, but I can still win material by capturing the pinned knight with my queen.}
    19. Qxa7 Qxa7
    20. Bxa7 Ra8
{I'm up material now, so I'll simplify the position by trading pieces.}
    21. Be3 Rxa
```
