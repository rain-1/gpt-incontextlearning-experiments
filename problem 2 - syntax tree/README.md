# Syntax Tree

## Background

This was an example I came up - convert a natural language sentence in a s-expression syntax tree.

## Conclusion

It would be worth doing a lot more testing of this. I only did one problem set.

It succeeded at this task. It added spurious newlines but I was very impressed that it gave a correct parse tree. This suggests that it is able to maintain some notion of how many brackets need closed (perhaps it just lucks out by pointing back at the right brackets using the attention mechanism), if not something more structural.
