generate python code with lists of 5 strings, make a list of animals, household objects, vehicles, computer scientists, viruses, weekdays, metals, physical laws

Here's some Python code to generate lists of 5 strings for each of the categories you mentioned:

python

# List of animals
animals = ['lion', 'tiger', 'elephant', 'giraffe', 'zebra']

# List of household objects
household_objects = ['chair', 'table', 'lamp', 'couch', 'bookshelf']

# List of vehicles
vehicles = ['car', 'motorcycle', 'bicycle', 'boat', 'airplane']

# List of computer scientists
computer_scientists = ['Ada Lovelace', 'Alan Turing', 'Grace Hopper', 'Tim Berners-Lee', 'Steve Jobs']

# List of viruses
viruses = ['influenza', 'Ebola', 'HIV', 'COVID-19', 'Zika']

# List of weekdays
weekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']

# List of metals
metals = ['gold', 'silver', 'iron', 'copper', 'aluminum']

# List of physical laws
physical_laws = ['Newton\'s laws of motion', 'Law of gravity', 'Ohm\'s law', 'Law of conservation of energy', 'Second law of thermodynamics']

These lists can be used in various applications, such as creating a game where the user has to guess a random word from one of these categories, or generating a random sentence using words from different categories.
write a function to print 3 randomly chosen items from a list

Sure! Here's a function in Python that takes a list as input and prints 3 randomly chosen items from the list:

python

import random

def print_random_items(lst):
    # Check if the list has at least 3 items
    if len(lst) < 3:
        print("List should have at least 3 items")
        return

    # Choose 3 random items from the list
    random_items = random.sample(lst, 3)

    # Print the 3 random items
    print("Three random items from the list are:")
    for item in random_items:
        print(item)

Here's an example of how you can use this function with one of the lists I generated earlier:

python

animals = ['lion', 'tiger', 'elephant', 'giraffe', 'zebra']
print_random_items(animals)
