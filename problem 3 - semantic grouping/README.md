# Semantic Grouping

## Background

This was an example I came up - group words semantically. This should take advantage of the word embedding that exists within the LLM system. I expect that this is kind of a tricky problem as you are outputting a permutation of a set of words.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT and GPT-4 were surprisingly good at this task. They were both able to solve it. ChatGPT required a retry in one example.
Furthermore they were able to *explain* what the problem was based on examples. They were also able to solve the problem in a zero-shot context by making use of GPT-4's task explanation.
